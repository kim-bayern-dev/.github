## About Us

The KI-Kompetenzzentrum Medien (KI.M) is the central hub for artificial intelligence in Bavaria's media industry. We support media companies in adopting AI solutions that are legally compliant, future-proof, and built on data-sovereign infrastructure.

We provide independent information and hands-on demonstrations of AI capabilities and limitations in media applications. Through our AI Lab, we collaborate with partners to test real-world implementations. Our feasibility studies are published as reports on our website, while the technical foundations and code are shared here in our repositories.

The KI.M is a joint initiative of the Bayrische Landeszentrale für neue Medien (BLM) and Medien.Bayern GmbH, supported by the Bavarian State Chancellery.

## Using Our Resources

Our repositories contain the technical implementations from our AI Lab projects. In combination with a report each project includes:

- :books: **Code & documentation**: Ready-to-explore implementations with detailed technical documentation
- :point_up: **Legal considerations**: We highlight relevant legal aspects to be aware of when deploying similar solutions
- :newspaper: **Project reports**: Comprehensive feasibility studies explaining use cases, methodologies, and findings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All code is designed for on-premise deployment, ensuring full data sovereignty and independence from cloud services.


## Completed Projects

Explore our finished projects and their detailed reports to learn from real-world AI implementations in media contexts. Each report includes technical insights, challenges encountered, and practical recommendations.
