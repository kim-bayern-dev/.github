## About Us

The KI.M (AI Competence Center Media) is the central hub for artificial intelligence in Bavaria's media industry. We support media companies in adopting AI solutions that are legally compliant, future-proof, and built on data-sovereign infrastructure.

We provide independent information and hands-on demonstrations of AI capabilities and limitations in media applications. Through our AI Lab, we collaborate with partners to test real-world implementations. Our feasibility studies are published as reports on our website, while the technical foundations and code are shared here in our repositories.

KI.M is a joint initiative of the Bavarian Regulatory Authority for Commercial Broadcasting (BLM) and Medien.Bayern, supported by the Bavarian State Chancellery.

## Using Our Resources

Our repositories contain the technical implementations from our AI Lab projects. In combination with a report each project includes:

- :books:**Code & Documentation**: Ready-to-explore implementations with detailed technical documentation
- :point_up:**Legal Considerations**: We highlight relevant legal aspects to be aware of when deploying similar solutions
- :newspaper:**Project Reports**: Comprehensive feasibility studies explaining use cases, methodologies, and findings

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All code is designed for on-premise deployment, ensuring full data sovereignty and independence from cloud services.
